Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I didn't have time to go into some of the design aspects of this project, so I would like to go into the logistics of that further.
2. I would like to learn how to create a collection view (I didn't have time for this)
